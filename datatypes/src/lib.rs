//!
//! Subscribable data types.
//!
//! A subscription is a request for a callback on a subset of network traffic specified by a filter.
//! Each callback function requires one or more *subscribable data types* as parameter(s), which it
//! immutably borrows.
//!
//! Each subscribable datatype must:
//!
//! - Be defined as a [DataType](retina_core::filter::DataType), with appropriate parameters and [retina_core::filter::Level].
//! - Implement one of the traits defined in this module (Tracked, FromSession, etc.)
//! - Be added to the [DATATYPES](`crate::typedefs::DATATYPES`) map (note: we are actively working on an approach that eliminates this requirement).
